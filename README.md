* Under [`/Local/`](https://github.com/ga-vo/Tutorias-TelegramBot-Py-AWS/tree/master/Local) you can find a file to run locally on your machine
* Under [`/AWS Lambda/`](https://github.com/ga-vo/Tutorias-TelegramBot-Py-AWS/tree/master/AWS%20Lambda) you will find the file `lambda_function.py` that can be 
used directly in AWS (It's necessary to upload the libraries), it's also necessary to configure an API Gateway or trigger.
